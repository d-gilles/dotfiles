Prompts to Simplify Project Handling:

Act as a programmer who excels at revising and optimizing GitHub repositories.
I will provide you with the folder structure and the code of each file through multiple inputs. The first line of each input will always contain the file name or the nature of the content.
Please confirm each input with an "OK".
Once the data input is complete, I will assign you tasks:

1.
Please write a README.md for a GitHub repository containing these files. Output everything in a code block in Markdown format.
2.
Make suggestions to optimize the code.
