# David's Configuration Repository

This repository serves as the foundation for my development environment. It encompasses a series of configuration files, scripts, and vital tool setups crucial for orchestrating a new machine in accordance with my preferences.

In addition to these config files, you can find a terrafrom configuration for GCP in the ```setup_remote_mashine/``` folder. This can be used to set up a remote VM as a development environment on Google Cloud Plattform.

## Credit
This configuration repository draws inspiration from and is based on the [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles) by Le Wagon. A heartfelt thank you to the Le Wagon team for laying the groundwork and sharing their invaluable configurations. It has significantly streamlined the setup process and continues to serve as a solid foundation for personal customizations.
The main changes I made were:
1. Cleaning up a lot of stuff I don't need because I'm not a webdev and don't use a Mac.
2. Customizing the terminal theme for python/pyenv/git
3. Automating the whole setup process to just clone the repo and execute one script.
4. Adding some tools and aliases that I like to use.
5. Setting up the Terraform configuration.
